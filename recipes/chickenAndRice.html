        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The Brits get a bad rap for their cuisine, and in some cases rightfully so—
            the beef cooked until gray and the gravy-made-from-granules that I ate every 
            Sunday while staying in England were not the height of culinary greatness— 
            but dang if there aren't a lot of things they do better than almost anyone else. 
            I'm talking savory pies, fried fish, Yorkshire puddings, and roasted potatoes. 
            The British method of roasting potatoes is one that I've taken a strong liking 
            to. It's simple, and it produces amazing results. Boil chunks of potato until 
            they're just tender, toss them none-too-gently with fat (ideally beef drippings) 
            to rough up their surface, then roast them until they're crisp and crackling.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda</li>
            <li>4 pounds (about 2 kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat</li>
            <li>Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.</li>
            <li>When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
